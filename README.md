# SECRES CTF

This repo stores the Ansible playbook to build the VM for a CTF that we made for the SECRES course (network security) at Sorbonne University.

If you want to try the CTF, you can just download the prebuilt VM image from the releases page.


The VM is built using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). You need both of them installed if you want to build the VM by yourself.

To build the VM, just clone the repo and run `vagrant up` inside the root of the repository.
